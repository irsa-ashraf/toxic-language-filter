"If only people would just take a step back and not make this case about them, because it wasn't about anyone except the two people in that situation.  To lump yourself into this mess and take matters into your own hands makes these kinds of protests selfish and without rational thought and investigation.  The guy in this video is heavily emotional and hyped up and wants to be heard, and when he gets heard he just presses more and more.  He was never out to have a reasonable discussion.  Kudos to the Smerconish for keeping level the whole time and letting Masri make himself out to be a fool.  How dare he and those that tore that city down in protest make this about themselves and to dishonor the entire incident with their own hate.  By the way, since when did police brutality become an epidemic?  I wish everyone would just stop pretending like they were there and they knew EXACTLY what was going on, because there's no measurable amount of people that honestly witnessed this incident, so none of us have a clue on which way this whole issue should have swung.  The grand jury were the most informed, we have to trust the majority rule was the right course of action and let it be.  Also, thank you to the 99.999% of police officers in America that actually serve & protect, even if you're a bit of a jerk when you pull me over, I respect your job and know that someone has to do it and that many people are going to pout about being held accountable to their actions.  People hate police until they need an officer or two around in an emergency.",0,0,0,0

"Thus, with a collapse of the USA, only two possibilities can be considered, whereby, with the one, it boils down to a dictatorship with evil reprisals, while the other possibility may be a new reconstruction, if people who are fundamentally conscious of their responsibilities attain government and really do everything to bring about an effective and valuable new start. But whether this will actually occur, is currently extremely questionable, because presently, in a totalitarian manner, everything is directed towards interests which are economic, military, political and cultural – as well as towards that which is strict fundamentalist religious-sectarian – and based on enormous lies and devious, misanthropic, criminal and felonious machinations in every imaginable regard. This also means that the population of the USA is spied upon by the secret services and even severely within the neighbourhoods, and so forth, and, in every possible manner being restricted in its freedom, and this is in addition to the violence, as it emerges in some form or other, both openly and covertly.﻿",0,0,0,0

"This case has overshadowed the cops that murdered a kid with a fake sword in Saratoga Springs, Utah. I am just as much outraged by the Mike brown case.

The shooting in Utah unwarranted because he ran, don't know why he ran but if you lunged at the police with the fake sword you should have taken that opportunity for immediate action right then. He ran and was shot 6 times in the back. We know a large group of cops are corrupt and these murderers are nothing new. Though I have ran from the police many times when I was in my teens, cops just pursue and find him hiding some where. Not just put 6 bullets in the back ending a life. They said in some paper, Saratoga Springs has about 5% of black population.. I have been through there and I would say they were off by about 5%. ",0,0,0,0

Let's get this straight and present the facts as the mass media should have from the beginning. 18 yr old (by all legal aspects an adult) robs a convince store. The criminal later flees the seen and is aprehended by the police. Resists arrest and altercation occurs between the two. The police (as in every case similar to this uses force). Criminal is killed. The killing goes to court. A randomly selected jury views all the evidence and hears out all witnesses which pertain to the case.  Radom jury reaches unanimous verdict of not guilty.

"Proof Blacks aren't victims:
1. Statistically Cops kill more whites than blacks, yet whites see them as necessary because they save more lives than they cost, while places like Ferguson lose their minds.
2. Statistically 93% of murdered blacks are killed by other blacks, with whites consisting of 3% of the murderers and 4% being the other races.
3. Whites were enslaved by blacks first, and for over 150 years. This was when Europeans(the same race that started America and later enslaved Africans) began searching North Africa to establish trade of goods between natives. From the 1520s to the late 1600s whites were enslaved first. Later the tables turned. This boys and girls is called 'Karma.'
4. Statistically over 50% of murders in the US alone are from Blacks, despite them making up only 14.1% of the entire US population, while despite whites make up 63% of the US population they only make up 46% of the murders.
5. Whites make up 38% of welfare recipients with blacks making up 39%. This doesn't seem extreme until you realize that 39%(blacks) consists of that 14.1%, whith that 38%(whites) making up 63% of the US. Meaning each individual black person is about 5 times as likely than whites to use welfare.",1,0,0,1

"*WHAT DOES TRAYVON MARTIN AND MICHAEL BROWN HAVE IN COMMON?*  
*THE REAL REASON BEHIND THE RIOTS THAT NO ONE DARE SPEAK OF.*

As with the Zimmerman case the common factors here are those race mongers like Al  Sharpton, CNN and MSNBC whipping up the black community to see racism where there is no racism and injustice where there is no injustice.

Give it a year or two and I can promise you, there WILL be another Zimmerman or Michael Brown style case.
 
*But the bigger question is WHY will there be a similar case?* 

Because rather than face the REAL  root cause of  many of the problems suffered by black Americans - poverty , high crime, the high black on black murder rate, it is far easier to turn a blind eye , and point the finger and shout RACISM !   

*SO WHAT IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF BLACK PROBLEMS IN AMERICA IF ITS NOT RACISM?*

The root cause is the break down of the black American family and the high number of fatherless children growing up in single parent homes. The governments own statistics reveal that children born into fatherless homes are more likely to drop out of school, more likely to have a history of unemployment, high chance of poverty,  and more likely to serve time in prison - the list goes on and on.

When we look at the fact that 70% of black children will grow up in a fatherless home compared to 24% of  white children we see a number that begins to explain WHY black poverty and black crime is so high amongst blacks in America with 70% of black mothers on welfare.

Complied with a dysfunctional gangster-rap culture that glorifies promiscuity, drug dealers the abuse of women and the power of the gun, we see a problem beginning to emerge and the reason for the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown begin to come clear.

Black Americans, a 13% minority, are doing 54% of the dying and probably 54% of the killing. That needs to be said. So now we have black culture of violence financed by the welfare system. 

*CONCLUSION*

*Like i said - there WILL BE  another ""race based case"" sooner or latter - in fact it will NEVER end. As long as race mongers like Sharpton , CNN and MSNBC continue to promote the idea that its all about racism rather than the disintegration of the black American family another Ferguson is just around the corner !*",0,0,0,0

"THE UGLY TRUTH:

If you talk like a THUG, act like a THUG, walk like a THUG, and live like a THUG... Then you will die like a THUG!

""Live by the sword die by the sword."" - ""Don't hate the player, hate the game!""

This was not an innocent little child just walking down the street who got shot in the back. If we cannot blame the parents then we must look at the individual who in this case was an adult. 

What kind of music did he listen to?
What kind of videos did he view?
Who were his role models?
How did his environment affect him?
Who were the enablers?
Who did he associate with?
But most importantly, when will he be accountable for his own actions? Unfortunately, on this day, he chose the wrong pathway to his fate. 

You cannot rob a store and call it shoplifting. Heck, you might as well call it borrowing without permission. 

This was not his first crime and there were probably many unrecorded (not caught) negative actions by Mike Brown (MB). You cannot assault another human being without consequences. Or should we say ""he was just playing, it was no big deal, or it was childish"". Get real folks. The riots, looting, attacks, and threats has nothing to do with MB. It has to do with a culture who feel they are entitled and will use any excuse or propaganda to find any excuse to commit crimes in the name of ""No Justice - No Peace!""

Hands Up - Don't Shoot!"" - Please this culture needs to STOP, ""Pants on the ground, Pants on the Ground, Looking like a Fool, with your Pants on the Ground! Hat turned Sideways, Gold in your mouth, Looking like a Fool, with your Pants on the Ground!""

Let me say, THIS IS NOT ABOUT RACE! THIS IS NOT ABOUT LACK OF JUSTICE! 

JUSTICE, naturally in the street, will usually end in tragedy. This was the result of an immature with no respect THUG who believed he could use his size to intimidate. He probably did it in school and we know he did it in the street.

--------- REAL PARENTS (or those around them) would have not called what MB did ""Childish"". That was not, nor is childish behaviors. His behaviors were felonious and criminal. And to be frank, would have probably cost him his life elsewhere at a different time. REAL PARENTS would have stated, ""This was my son. What he did was wrong in this store and to the clerk. If in fact, the evidence shows my son assaulted this officer, and posed a threat by going after the officer before the shots were fired... Then may our son rest in peace as his actions we do not condone but this consequence was just due to his own choices and actions. We unconditionally love our son. However, we also forgive the officer. We apologize to the store clerk and we hope as a family and people can move on only to learn, our actions and how we live dictate our consequences, be it positive or negative. We would also like to support alternate methods in the event this does happen again using non-lethal weapons such as rubber bullets, taser, mace, etc. ----------- And to those who truly support change - NO SILENCE - NO VIOLENCE.

There is no sugar coat here. As a human, as a race, we need to be accountable for what we say and do. 

Lastly, If the officer was racist and he did shoot MB without rhyme or reason, or if he in fact, just targeted MB & DJ because they were black, and decided to gun down MB (in the back and front) even though he surrendered peacefully with his hands raised, THEN I would side with MB and those who support the cause.

But unfortunately, the evidence thus far does not support the above paragraph. 

Question 1: Would this still be the reaction, if the officer were a female?

Question 2: Would this still be the reaction, if the officer were Black/African American?

Question 3: Would this still be the reaction, if Mike Brown was gunned down by a peer of his own race?

Question 4: Would this still be the reaction, if Mike Brown were White?

Question 5: Would this still be the end result (death), if Mike Brown was productive at home, work, or school other than running the streets?

To the people:

""Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity."" - Martin Luther King, Jr.
I think it is safe to say, we are living in dangerous times because of this simple fact proving  this Martin Luther King, Jr.'s quote.  Unfortunately, it is coming from his own race and those supporting a lost cause.

To the people who cry wolf...

While I agree with most of your report and I certainly think that the events that went down in Ferguson need to be investigated.

"Someone has to say this so I will.
With the way most black people behave no wonder Ferguson is such a shitty place.
Most black people in the US are so fucking lazy.
I am saying this because of countless examples from my life:
1. My grandmother got a black house nurse once and the bitch did nothing all day. When my grandmother complained to the agency they sent a different woman (wasn't black) that cleaned the entire house in 4 hours.
2. My mom works at a hospital as a nurse and all her black co workers constantly do nothing and are lazy.
Now once again. not all black people are like this (one of my best friends is black and I like him like a brother) but most of them are. The fucks expect to get everything they want only because their ancestors were once slaves. 
Well, Hitler killed most of my ancestors, do you see me with sagging pants and crying like a stupid bitch about it like those stupid black people?

The inequality of representation is probably because (again) black people are generally lazy or lack the skills required to hold such positions. 
The household income ties into my previous point (lazy/lacking skill = lower income jobs).
The dropout rate from school need to be taken against the black people at Ferguson, because, once again, how will you hold a high paying job if you didn't even graduate fucking high school?
The 80% worse healthcare is once again tied into the low income. More money = better doctors.
As for the inequality of enforcement, I have to give you that one that is completely unfair, however, when looking at black officers they frisk mostly black people as well, hmmmm..... interesting? maybe.",1,0,1,1

"Here is an intellectual and mature approach to this case

1- as a black man myself at 32 many of older black men or in prison, dead or stuck in the matrix as truthers struggling. Because there are no older men to guide these younger males, they often encounter police without understanding how to deal with a cop. Many of their role models come from rappers, who only advocate violence against police. So they are deers caught in the headlights of a potential life and death encounter. (Racism or Not)

2- Many black people are ranting about a hate crime, but clearly he assaulted the store clerk, which indicates the propensity of violence against Wilson. Stop pointing the finger and address the problems black teens have with their lack of male role models.

3-With that being said, black people need to address the alternatives of dealing with suspects/victims with non-lethal weaponry to deal with these encounters. If we as a race start to focus on solutions to a possible violent encounter with alternatives, then we can see progress with the police.

4- You can't go out and protest and burn down your communities in retalitation against a police, this only supports a theory that Brown was a product of a violent environment. Because how is burning down businesses going to solve the problem with the police department? This is counter-productive.

5-It was a hoax....",0,0,0,0

The major difference between the Zimmerman case and this one is that the shooter Zimmerman's name was not withheld and he was taken into custody.  News media were able to document Zimmerman's injuries immediately.  This case was handled horribly by a lack of immediate transparency.   Because even if everything is true from the PO it will be questioned as a cover-up.  Also the community has a history of Police abuse and missing videos after alleged abuse has occurred.  The response to media and peaceful protesters also showed a complete lack of understanding about escalation.  Unlike authorities dealing with potential Zimmerman looting and riots PD in this case attacked protesters rather than station themselves near looting targets to protect businesses.  Criminals will always take the opportunity of distractions like storms or blackout or protests to loot.  Authorities know this.  And they know it is great propaganda against protesters who are seen as the cause of the looting rather than the PD who failed to protect businesses.  It also illustrates why the 2nd Amendment is so valuable.  Business owners that depended on PD for protection got looted while business owners that depended on themselves and their right to bear arms were not looted. ,0,0,0,0

"Couple things you missed on both sides of the argument. Firstly yes, the guy was dead, very very dead and it was a crime scene....of course they didn't cover the body.
Secondly, the officer seems to have not called in the incident based on multiple sources. Very odd. 
In addition, I make no excuses for strong armed robbery....but I don't understand why if you have the money for the weed you need to rob for the cigars. Regardless it doesn't excuse getting shot down in the street. Even if you ignore the eyewitness accounts and assume they are all lying, 6 shots is blatantly excessive. 
Lastly, as you admit yourself rapping is not against the law, and most of what you mentioned that they rapped about isn't against the law. The only things that come close is smoking marijuana, which is of course legal now in some states, and getting in fights, which teenagers will do and always will do.",0,0,0,0

"Here in Finland with a population of over 5 million and a police force of about 7800, police use their weapons about 40 times a year. The use of weapons includes pointing the weapon at someone. 

There are around 10-15 shots fired every year by the police and most of these are warning shots.There's approximately 1-2 shots fired at people per year by the police in all of Finland. 

Many of these shots are shot at extremities and the deaths are quite rare, but there has been a case where a man was coming towards two police officers with a machete and was shot at first once in the leg. When he still was gripping the machete and waved it around from the ground the other officer fired once more, penetrating both legs. The man later died in the the hospital and the second police officer was found guilty of manslaughter and use of excessive force. 

And this is in a country that has 3rd most guns in civilian hands in the world and is at 10th position in deaths caused by firearms. 

But unlike in America, our police enjoys a high amount of public trust, placing at 5th most trustworthy profession, behind firemen and doctors. 

Maybe there could be something gained if american cops took some pointers from other countries police procedures instead of playing cowboys.

EDIT: Finnish police wear a blue overall that is resistant to knife cuts when on duty and put on cut-resistant gloves when on a call. This gives them more ways to deal with threats.

"Thank you. Finally, a powerful voice for the truth from the black community. 93% of black killings are perpetrated by blacks. For the most part, even the 7% of black murders by non-blacks are not directed at innocent black citizens, but rather drug or gang related. Donald Trump, Star Parker, I hope you are aware of Peggy Hubbard's comments and address this issue as honestly as she has. There needs to be a seat at the table for Ms. Hubbard in the Trump campaign and administration.

Race Mongers like Obama, Eric Holder, Pelosi, Reid, Jessie Jackson, Al Sharpton, the NAACP, the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Democrats (of all ethnicities, and on all levels of government), and the mainstream media have all conspired over the last 50 years to turn viable black communities into government-dependent ghettos by knowingly advancing a false narrative of systemic White (conservative) racism.
 
Perhaps their greatest accomplishment is the destruction of the black nuclear family. Seventy-two percent of black children are born to single mothers.  Why get married or limit the number of children you have, when Obama and the progressives will gladly extort taxpayer money to take care of you and your illegitimate children in exchange for guaranteed votes to keep themselves in power.  This master plan and policy insures generations of newly created disaffected and dysfunctional adults who will necessarily become democratic voters.

If the race hustlers mentioned above, reacted in the same way to black on black killings, they could go into those neighborhoods and with their power, wipe out all the gangs, minimize the drug use and give the community some real “hope” and “change.”  It will never happen.  They need black communities to be dependent and feel hopeless in order to maintain their power and control.  They are living the good life off the backs of their own people, while deceiving them into thinking they care.  Just think – if these purveyors of lies and damn lies couldn't make race an issue over the past 40 years they would have to get “real” jobs like the rest of us.",0,0,0,0

He was shot while he was assaulting the officer. Now before you say well this and that. Why didn't the officer do this or that. Well unless you have been or are a police officer you can't say the officer did something stupid or should have done something else. This officer was being attacked by a man much larger than him.

Micheal brown was shot 151 feet away from Daren Wilson`s patrol car so there is no way that he couldn't get him self out of that situation he continued the conflict between them two there was no reason to shoot him there where other options like pepper spray or his tazer.,0,0,0,0

Also, they say they want justice. . than why go around destroying private property and looting shops, how in their right mind would ask for justice and rob and destroy peoples lively hood at the same time.

It's as though these black communities think it is perfectly acceptable for a black person to kill a white cop but when the cop follows procedures and defends him self from a potential fatal attack they get angry . . yeah the black guy might not have had a firearm but could easily have had a knife or something. . why do they value other black people more than a white law enforcement officer. . life is equal and as such they should understand that the officer defended him self from an attack. . and yes it was an attack.    ",1,0,0,1
